        Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python Web site, https://www.python.org/, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.

        Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together other values. The most versatile is the list, which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items all have the same type.
      </p>
      <code>
        >>> squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25] <br>
        >>> squares <br>
        [1, 4, 9, 16, 25] <br>
      </code>
      <p>
        Like strings (and all other built-in sequence types), lists can be indexed and sliced:
      </p>
      <code>
        >>> squares[0]  # indexing returns the item <br>
        1 <br>
        >>> squares[-1] <br>
        25 <br>
        >>> squares[-3:]  # slicing returns a new list <br>
        [9, 16, 25] <br>
      </code>
      <p>
        The list data type has some more methods. Here are all of the methods of list objects:

        <h3>list.append(x)</h3>

            Add an item to the end of the list. Equivalent to a[len(a):] = [x].

        <h3>list.extend(iterable)</h3>

            Extend the list by appending all the items from the iterable. Equivalent to a[len(a):] = iterable.

        <h3>list.insert(i, x)</h3>

            Insert an item at a given position. The first argument is the index of the element before which to insert, so a.insert(0, x) inserts at the front of the list, and a.insert(len(a), x) is equivalent to a.append(x).

        <h3>list.remove(x)</h3>

            Remove the first item from the list whose value is equal to x. It raises a ValueError if there is no such item.

        <h3>list.pop([i])</h3>

            Remove the item at the given position in the list, and return it. If no index is specified, a.pop() removes and returns the last item in the list. (The square brackets around the i in the method signature denote that the parameter is optional, not that you should type square brackets at that position. You will see this notation frequently in the Python Library Reference.)

        <h3>list.clear()</h3>

            Remove all items from the list. Equivalent to del a[:].

        <h3>list.index(x[, start[, end]])</h3>

            Return zero-based index in the list of the first item whose value is equal to x. Raises a ValueError if there is no such item.

            The optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in the slice notation and are used to limit the search to a particular subsequence of the list. The returned index is computed relative to the beginning of the full sequence rather than the start argument.

        <h3>list.count(x)</h3>

            Return the number of times x appears in the list.

        <h3>list.sort(key=None, reverse=False)</h3>

            Sort the items of the list in place (the arguments can be used for sort customization, see sorted() for their explanation).

        <h3>list.reverse()</h3>

            Reverse the elements of the list in place.

        <h3>list.copy()</h3>

            Return a shallow copy of the list. Equivalent to a[:].

        An example that uses most of the list methods:
      </p>
      <code>
        >>> fruits = ['orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'banana', 'kiwi', 'apple', 'banana'] <br>
        >>> fruits.count('apple') <br>
        2 <br>
        >>> fruits.count('tangerine') <br>
        0 <br>
        >>> fruits.index('banana') <br>
        3 <br>
        >>> fruits.index('banana', 4)  # Find next banana starting a position 4 <br>
        6 <br>
        >>> fruits.reverse() <br>
        >>> fruits <br>
        ['banana', 'apple', 'kiwi', 'banana', 'pear', 'apple', 'orange'] <br>
        >>> fruits.append('grape') <br>
        >>> fruits <br>
        ['banana', 'apple', 'kiwi', 'banana', 'pear', 'apple', 'orange', 'grape'] <br>
        >>> fruits.sort() <br>
        >>> fruits <br>
        ['apple', 'apple', 'banana', 'banana', 'grape', 'kiwi', 'orange', 'pear'] <br>
        >>> fruits.pop() <br>
        'pear' <br>
      </code>

      <header>List Comprehensions</header>
      <p>
        List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. Common applications are to make new lists where each element is the result of some operations applied to each member of another sequence or iterable, or to create a subsequence of those elements that satisfy a certain condition.

        For example, assume we want to create a list of squares, like:
      </p>
      <code>
        >>> squares = []<br>
        >>> for x in range(10):<br>
        ...     squares.append(x**2)<br>
        ...<br>
        >>> squares<br>
        [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]<br>
      </code>
      <p>
        Note that this creates (or overwrites) a variable named x that still exists after the loop completes. We can calculate the list of squares without any side effects using:
      </p>
      <code>
        squares = list(map(lambda x: x**2, range(10)))
      </code>
      <p>
        or, equivalently:
      </p>
      <code>
        squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
      </code>
      <p>
        which is more concise and readable.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="The_del_statement">
      <header>The del statement</header>
      <p>
        There is a way to remove an item from a list given its index instead of its value: the del statement. This differs from the pop() method which returns a value. The del statement can also be used to remove slices from a list or clear the entire list (which we did earlier by assignment of an empty list to the slice). For example:
      </p>
      <code>
        >>> a = [-1, 1, 66.25, 333, 333, 1234.5]<br>
        >>> del a[0]<br>
        >>> a<br>
        [1, 66.25, 333, 333, 1234.5]<br>
        >>> del a[2:4]<br>
        >>> a<br>
        [1, 66.25, 1234.5]<br>
        >>> del a[:]<br>
        >>> a<br>
        []<br>
      </code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Tuples">
      <header>Tuples</header>
      <p>
        We saw that lists and strings have many common properties, such as indexing and slicing operations. They are two examples of sequence data types (see Sequence Types — list, tuple, range). Since Python is an evolving language, other sequence data types may be added. There is also another standard sequence data type: the tuple.

        A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas, for instance:
      </p>
      <code>
        >>> t = 12345, 54321, 'hello!'<br>
        >>> t[0]<br>
        12345<br>
        >>> t<br>
        (12345, 54321, 'hello!')<br>
      </code>
      <p>
        As you see, on output tuples are always enclosed in parentheses, so that nested tuples are interpreted correctly; they may be input with or without surrounding parentheses, although often parentheses are necessary anyway (if the tuple is part of a larger expression). It is not possible to assign to the individual items of a tuple, however it is possible to create tuples which contain mutable objects, such as lists.

        Though tuples may seem similar to lists, they are often used in different situations and for different purposes. Tuples are immutable, and usually contain a heterogeneous sequence of elements that are accessed via unpacking (see later in this section) or indexing (or even by attribute in the case of namedtuples). Lists are mutable, and their elements are usually homogeneous and are accessed by iterating over the list.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Sets">
      <header>Sets</header>
      <p>
        Python also includes a data type for sets. A set is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements. Basic uses include membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries. Set objects also support mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.

        Curly braces or the set() function can be used to create sets. Note: to create an empty set you have to use set(), not {}; the latter creates an empty dictionary, a data structure that we discuss in the next section.

        Here is a brief demonstration:
      </p>
      <code>
        >>> basket = {'apple', 'orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'orange', 'banana'}<br>
        >>> print(basket)                      # show that duplicates have been removed<br>
        {'orange', 'banana', 'pear', 'apple'}<br>
        >>> 'orange' in basket                 # fast membership testing<br>
        True<br>
        >>> 'crabgrass' in basket<br>
        False<br>

        >>> # Demonstrate set operations on unique letters from two words<br>
        ...<br>
        >>> a = set('abracadabra')<br>
        >>> b = set('alacazam')<br>
        >>> a                                  # unique letters in a<br>
        {'a', 'r', 'b', 'c', 'd'}<br>
        >>> a - b                              # letters in a but not in b<br>
        {'r', 'd', 'b'}<br>
        >>> a | b                              # letters in a or b or both<br>
        {'a', 'c', 'r', 'd', 'b', 'm', 'z', 'l'}<br>
        >>> a & b                              # letters in both a and b<br>
        {'a', 'c'}<br>
        >>> a ^ b                              # letters in a or b but not both<br>
        {'r', 'd', 'b', 'm', 'z', 'l'}<br>
      </code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Dictionaries">
      <header>Dictionaries</header>
      <p>
        Another useful data type built into Python is the dictionary (see Mapping Types — dict). Dictionaries are sometimes found in other languages as “associative memories” or “associative arrays”. Unlike sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys, which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys. Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key. You can’t use lists as keys, since lists can be modified in place using index assignments, slice assignments, or methods like append() and extend().         </p>
      <p>
        It is best to think of a dictionary as a set of key: value pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary). A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary: {}. Placing a comma-separated list of key:value pairs within the braces adds initial key:value pairs to the dictionary; this is also the way dictionaries are written on output.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main operations on a dictionary are storing a value with some key and extracting the value given the key. It is also possible to delete a key:value pair with del. If you store using a key that is already in use, the old value associated with that key is forgotten. It is an error to extract a value using a non-existent key.
      </p>
      <p>
        Performing list(d) on a dictionary returns a list of all the keys used in the dictionary, in insertion order (if you want it sorted, just use sorted(d) instead). To check whether a single key is in the dictionary, use the in keyword.

        Here is a small example using a dictionary:
      </p>
      <code>
        >>> tel = {'jack': 4098, 'sape': 4139}<br>
        >>> tel['guido'] = 4127<br>
        >>> tel<br>
        {'jack': 4098, 'sape': 4139, 'guido': 4127}<br>
        >>> tel['jack']<br>
        4098<br>
        >>> del tel['sape']<br>
        >>> tel['irv'] = 4127<br>
        >>> tel<br>
        {'jack': 4098, 'guido': 4127, 'irv': 4127}<br>
        >>> list(tel)<br>
        ['jack', 'guido', 'irv']<br>
        >>> sorted(tel)<br>
        ['guido', 'irv', 'jack']<br>
        >>> 'guido' in tel<br>
        True<br>
        >>> 'jack' not in tel<br>
        False<br>
      </code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="if_Statements">
      <header>if Statements</header>
      <p>
        Perhaps the most well-known statement type is the if statement. For example:
      </p>
      <code>
        >>> x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))<br>
Please enter an integer: 42<br>
        >>> if x < 0:<br>
        ...     x = 0<br>
        ...     print('Negative changed to zero')<br>
        ... elif x == 0:<br>
        ...     print('Zero')<br>
        ... elif x == 1:<br>
        ...     print('Single')<br>
        ... else:<br>
        ...     print('More')<br>
        ...<br>
        More<br>
      </code>
      <p>
        There can be zero or more elif parts, and the else part is optional. The keyword ‘elif’ is short for ‘else if’, and is useful to avoid excessive indentation. An if … elif … elif … sequence is a substitute for the switch or case statements found in other languages.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="for_Statements">
      <header>for Statements</header>
      <p>
        The for statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal. Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the ability to define both the iteration step and halting condition (as C), Python’s for statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence. For example (no pun intended):
      </p>
      <code>
        >>> # Measure some strings:<br>
        ... words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']<br>
        >>> for w in words:<br>
        ...     print(w, len(w))<br>
        ...<br>
        cat 3<br>
        window 6<br>
        defenestrate 12<br>
      </code>
      <p>
        If you need to modify the sequence you are iterating over while inside the loop (for example to duplicate selected items), it is recommended that you first make a copy. Iterating over a sequence does not implicitly make a copy. The slice notation makes this especially convenient:
      </p>
      <code>
        >>> for w in words[:]:  # Loop over a slice copy of the entire list.<br>
        ...     if len(w) > 6:<br>
        ...         words.insert(0, w)<br>
        ...<br>
        >>> words<br>
        ['defenestrate', 'cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']<br>
      </code>
      <p>
        With for w in words:, the example would attempt to create an infinite list, inserting defenestrate over and over again.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="The_range_Function">
      <header>The range Function</header>
      <p>
        If you do need to iterate over a sequence of numbers, the built-in function range() comes in handy. It generates arithmetic progressions:
      </p>
      <code>
        >>> for i in range(5):<br>
        ...     print(i)<br>
        ...<br>
        0<br>
        1<br>
        2<br>
        3<br>
        4<br>
      </code>
      <p>
        The given end point is never part of the generated sequence; range(10) generates 10 values, the legal indices for items of a sequence of length 10. It is possible to let the range start at another number, or to specify a different increment (even negative; sometimes this is called the ‘step’):
      </p>
      <code>
        range(5, 10)<br>
         5, 6, 7, 8, 9<br>

      range(0, 10, 3)<br>
         0, 3, 6, 9<br>

      range(-10, -100, -30)<br>
        -10, -40, -70<br>
      </code>
